Added this branch to work on creating a lookup table to simulate the potential shadowing effects that will influence certain detectors onboard BurstCube.


The work is done. Here's what I should do in front of Jeremy to make sure it doesn't get screweed up.

run the tests

push to master

check 

These tests should be working, I don't understand what's happening so that it doesn't read in "GRBgenerator.py etc. "
