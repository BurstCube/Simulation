In the "out with the old" notebook, I've updated the simulation so now it runs lightyears faster than the initial code. 

It still retains the same capabilities, and is now actually a useful tool for scientific use!

What's left is to update the functions used to deploy the simulation, print out a few plots, and try out a couple of alternating versions to track their effectiveness. 




NoahSim
=======

In here is all of Noah Kasmanoff's python based simulations of BurstCube. The simulations generate GRBs of a given strength throughout the sky, and reproduce the effect in a model of BurstCube with the desired parameters (detector tilt, background, instrument shadowing, etc.) to reconstruct the GRB, and give the user a sense of how well BurstCube performs at a certain point and/or throughout the sky. TSM plotting also available. 


To run these simulations, on your terminal enter "python runnoahsims.py". Inside runnoahsims.py the parameters are designated. For more information please refer to the documentation available.
